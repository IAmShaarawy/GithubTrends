# Github Trends repo

I used the clean architecture

Applies TDD by tanking first about test and then make it pass

Built the application from bottom up, underline data layer, domain, and the presentation

Used hilt as a dependency injection lib to help me in development and testing

Did not use modularization and depended on monotonic application for simplicity

Used Kover for code coverage just run `./gradlew koverHtmlReport` in the terminal and check the 69.7% test coverage in the report

Hostilely i dd not put that match effort in design and the UI, but i think it is acceptable 

Thanks!
